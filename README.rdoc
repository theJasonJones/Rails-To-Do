== Rails To-Do

This was a project I used to familiarize myself with Ruby on Rails. This app, as you probably already guessed, is a to-do list that allows a user to:

* Add a to-do item
* Edit that item
* Delete that item

I developed this app through TDD using Capybara (https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) and rspec (https://github.com/rspec/rspec).
